-implement auto-filling of database with all current series
	-can be done by iterating through the last 4 weeks of releases and dumping them into the db
		-subproblem: finding the date of the upcoming wednesday and the 3 wednesdays prior
		-if a series is not already in the database, add it
		-subproblem: how to decide if an entry is worth adding
			-can use the utility functions in scrapeComicList to ignore trades, one-shots, and variant covers
			-subproblem: but what if we want a one-shot to be added, for the current week, and then removed later?
				-we can add an field to the entity describing the format of the series. TP and One shots can be handled this way
-implement user system
	-signup: technically taken care of if i just use google login. GOOD ENOUGH
	-login: don't know how this will work in an api, right now can only do it in web
	-allow users to select series to follow
	-lookup of weekly releases happens serverside for ALL series in db, user just gets series they care about
		-should this be automated: server updates all users' entities with new releases, or should users be the ones to pull their own updates
		-send notification? either via text or email. optional.

-figure out how to make api

-make api
-make webportal
-make android app
