-implement auto-filling of database with all current series
		-subproblem: how to decide if an entry is worth adding
			-can use the utility functions in scrapeComicList to ignore trades, one-shots, and variant covers
			-subproblem: but what if we want a one-shot to be added, for the current week, and then removed later?
				-we can add an field to the entity describing the format of the series. TP and One shots can be handled this way
				-not sure if i care enough to do that
-implement user system
	-signup: technically taken care of if i just use google login. GOOD ENOUGH
	-login: don't know how this will work in an api, right now can only do it in web
	-add a date field to a cList, to keep track of the last time a list was updated. use this to check when to perform updates
	-also a date field on series, to keep track of last time an issue was released, to clear out things that end
	-user gets updates for series they care about
		-should this be automated: server updates all users' entities with new releases, or should users be the ones to pull their own updates
		-send notification? either via text or email. optional.

-figure out how to make api

-make api
